Meteor Skeleton App w/ CoffeeScript
===================================

How to structure a Meteor app seems to be a popular question.  This is a rough guide of what I have used in the past, and I will be using this repo to start new projects going forward.  Hope it helps!

As of now the structure is a copy of the recommended structure found at [Unofficial Meteor FAQ](https://github.com/oortcloud/unofficial-meteor-faq).  I will be pushing some changes soon, but I highly recommend reading through that.
